# Tubules Proximity Analysis
Analysis performed for the publication L. Wong BioRxiv 2023 (provisional). 
A mask of the vesicle structures is performed with an intensity threshold, selected for each channel. This mask is used for the identification of the structure boundaries. The centroid position is calculated, and used for the nearest neightbour calculation.
